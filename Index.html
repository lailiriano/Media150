<p>My work is deeply inspired by the people in my life. I draw much of my creativity from my environment and the relationships that shape me. I am especially interested in capturing nostalgic moments and immortalizing them through my art. I find meaning in the mundane, highlighting everyday experiences and revealing the quiet beauty within them.
As I continue to grow, I hope to branch out and explore more political and culturally impactful themes. I feel strongly about using my art as a voice for the communities I am a part of, creating work that not only reflects personal memory but also speaks to shared experiences and collective identity. </p>
